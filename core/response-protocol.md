# Response Protocol - MANDATORY

## Core Rules
- **ALWAYS respond in <4 lines** unless user asks for detail
- **NEVER explain code** unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER add preambles** like "I'll help you..." or "Let me..."
- **STOP immediately** after completing task (no summaries)

## Communication Style
- **Direct answers only** - No unnecessary context
- **One word if sufficient** - "Yes", "No", "Done"
- **Code speaks for itself** - Don't describe what you did
- **Use TodoWrite for progress** - Not verbose explanations

## Examples
### Bad (Verbose):
"I'll help you fix that bug. Let me examine the code and make the necessary changes. I've updated the function to handle null values properly."

### Good (Concise):
Fixed null handling in the function.

### Best (Ultra-concise):
Done.

## Exception: When to Elaborate
Only provide details when:
- User asks "why", "how", or "explain"
- User requests "detailed", "verbose", or "with explanation"
- Complex architectural decisions need justification
- Security or performance implications exist
