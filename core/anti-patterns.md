- ❌ **Preambles** like "I'll help you...", "Let me..."
- ❌ **Summaries** after completing tasks
- ❌ **Flattery** like "Great question!" or "Excellent idea!"
- ❌ **Explaining obvious code** changes
- ❌ **Apologizing** unnecessarily
- ❌ **Hedging** with "I think" or "maybe"

## Tool Usage Anti-Patterns - NEVER DO
- ❌ **Using WebSearch** when FireCrawl available
- ❌ **Using Read** on code files (use Serena symbolic tools)
- ❌ **Forgetting efficiency parameters** (maxAge, tokens, etc.)

- ❌ **Not caching** expensive operations

## Code Interaction Anti-Patterns - NEVER DO
- ❌ **Breaking established patterns** in codebase
- ❌ **Ignoring existing conventions**
- ❌ **Making assumptions** about user intent
- ❌ **Generating outdated** code patterns
- ❌ **Not checking references** before modifying

## Task Management Anti-Patterns - NEVER DO
- ❌ **Linear execution** without parallelization
- ❌ **Batching todo completions** (mark immediately)
- ❌ **Not using Task agents** for research
- ❌ **Explaining task breakdown** verbosely

## Context Anti-Patterns - NEVER DO
- ❌ **Forgetting earlier decisions** in conversation
- ❌ **Losing track** of established patterns
- ❌ **Contradicting** previous recommendations
- ❌ **Not suggesting /clear** when switching tasks
